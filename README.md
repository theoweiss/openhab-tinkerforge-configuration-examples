## Introduction
[TinkerForge](http://www.tinkerforge.com) is a system of open source hardware building blocks that
allows you to combine sensor and actuator blocks by plug and play. You can create your individual
hardware system by choosing the necessary building blocks for your project and combine it with other
home automation products. There are many blocks available e.g for temperature, humidity or air pressure
measurement as well as for I/O, LCDs and motor control. You will find a complete List of available
blocks [here](http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Product_Overview.html).

This binding connects the [TinkerForge](http://tinkerforge.com) devices to the openHAB event bus.
Sensor values from devices are made available to openHAB and actions on  devices can be triggered by
openHAB.

The binding supports the connection to several brickd instances.
The TinkerForge auto reconnect feature is supported. Furthermore even if the initial connect failed the binding will make retries to get connected to the brickd.

The TinkerForge binding bundle is available as a separate (optional) download. For installation of
the binding, please see Wiki page [[Bindings]].

## Supported Devices

### DC Brick

https://bintray.com/artifact/download/theoweiss/generic/org.openhab.binding.tinkerforge-1.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
The binding will work with 1.6.x versions of openHAB.

#### Incompatible changes
* DriveMode now is one of "brake" or "coast" instead of "0" or "1"
```
tinkerforge:dc_garage.driveMode=brake
```

* switchOnVelocity in openhab.cfg is no longer needed and has gone.
It is replaced by per item configuration:
With the benefit that you can have serveral switch items with different speeds.
~~tinkerforge:dc_garage.switchOnVelocity=10000~~
```
Switch DCSWITCH "DC Switch" {tinkerforge="uid=62Zduj, speed=14000"}
```


#### Whats new?
Support for Dimmer, Rollershuter and Number items. Besides that the speed
can be set using a percent value.

The number items show the current velocity. The values are reported using the VelocityListener.
"callbackPeriod" and "threshold" for the listener can be configured in openhab.cfg. There is more
documentation about callback listeners at the official openHAB TinkerForgeBindig wiki page.

* callbackPeriod: milliseconds
* threshold: numeric value

#### New item configuration options
* speed: the target speed (Switch)
* max: the maximum speed (Dimmer, Rollershutter)
* min: the minimum speed (Dimmer, Rollershutter)
* step: the step value for increasing decreasing speed (Dimmer)
* leftspeed: the speed when the left rollershutter controller is pressed or command "DOWN" was send
* rightspeed: the speed when the right rollershutter controller is pressed or command "UP" was send
* acceleration: acceleration overrides value from openhab.cfg
* drivemode: drivemode  overrides value from openhab.cfg

#### Example
openhab.cfg

```
tinkerforge:dc_garage.uid=62Zduj
tinkerforge:dc_garage.type=brick_dc
tinkerforge:dc_garage.pwmFrequency=15000
tinkerforge:dc_garage.driveMode=break
tinkerforge:dc_garage.acceleration=10000
tinkerforge:dc_garage.callbackPeriod=100
```
#### Item

Dimmer  RULEDIMMER  "RuleDimmer"
```
#### Sitemap
```
sitemap tf_weather label="Brick DC"
{
  Frame {
        Switch item=TF_ROLLER
        Switch item=DCSWITCH
        Slider item=DCDIMMER
        Text item=DCSPEED
        Setpoint item=DCSPEED minValue=-1500 maxValue=25000 step=1000
        Slider item=RULEDIMMER
        }
}
```
#### Rules
```
import org.openhab.core.library.types.*

rule "percentdimmer"
    when
        Item RULEDIMMER received command INCREASE
    then
       sendCommand(DIMMERPERCENT, new PercentType(100))
end

rule "percentdimmerdecrease"
    when
        Item RULEDIMMER received command DECREASE
    then
       sendCommand(DIMMERPERCENT, new PercentType(25))
end
```

### Servo Brick

old content:
For the Servo Brick you can configure the velocity, acceleration, servo voltage, pulse width min,
pulse width max, period and the output voltage (must be equal for all servos). The device type is
"servo". Available subid's are servo0 to servo6.

The current implementation is more or less for demo purposes. The servo can only be used as a switch
item, to move the servo to the most left or most right position.

#### TinkerForge Action
The new openHAB action TinkerForgeAction comes up with the action tfServoSetposition.
tfServoSetposition(uid, num, position, velocity, acceleration) can be used to control the servo.
#### Example
```
tfServoSetposition("6Crt5W", "servo0", "-9000", "65535", "65535")
```

### Dual Button Bricklet

The Dual Button Bricklet has four sub devices: two leds and two buttons.
The subids are:
 * dualbutton_leftled
 * dualbutton_rightled
 * dualbutton_leftbutton
 * dualbutton_rightbutton

Leds
====
There are two operating modes for the leds: with the autotoggle=True the leds are
automatically toggled whenever the corresponding button is pressed. With the autotoggle=False
mode the leds are fully controlled with openHAB UIs or rules. The default autotoggle mode is
autotoggle=False. The autotoggle mode can be configured using openhab.cfg.

#### Buttons

There are also two operating modes for the buttons. The buttons can behave like a switch or
like a tactile switch.  
* Switch mode
The switch mode operates like this: pressing the button toggles the
switch state, if state was ON it goes to OFF and vice versa. Releasing the button doesn't
change anything, only the next button press will change the state.
* Tactile switch mode
Pressing the button changes the switch state to ON and releasing the button changes the
state back to OFF again.

### Joystick Bricklet

There are three sub devices: joystick_xposition, joystick_yposition and joystick_button.
Callback period for xy position defaults to 10 milli seconds. CallbackPeriod must be configured
on bricklet_joystick device, because x and y position can not have
different callback periods.

#### Button
Two operating modes for the button. The button can behave like a switch or
like a tactile switch.  
* Switch mode
The switch mode operates like this: pressing the button toggles the
switch state, if state was ON it goes to OFF and vice versa. Releasing the button doesn't
change anything, only the next button press will change the state.
* Tactile switch mode
Pressing the button changes the switch state to ON and releasing the button changes the
state back to OFF again.

Switch Mode is the default mode you can change the mode to tactile by adding a line like this
to your openhab.cfg:
```
tinkerforge:joystickbutton.tactile=True
```


### LCD 20x4 Display Bricklet

The LCD20x4 is a bit special as it acts as actuator which can receive text messages. To
achieve this, you have to configure the device as String item.


Whatâ€™s the meaning of this magic string?

    sendCommand(TF_LCD, String::format("TFNUM<213>%4s"Barometer.state.format("%d")
                      ))

TFNUM is just a flag to signal the binding that some position information is passed. The first
number is the line number, starting from 0. The second and third number are interpreted as the
position in the line, starting from 0.

The above example would write the current value of the barometer bricklet to line 3 starting from
position 14, with a fixed width of 4 (this is because of %4s).

## Generic Item Binding Configuration

### Basic Configuration
In order to connect openHAB to TinkerForge devices you need to define all the brickd hosts and ports
in the openhab.cfg file.

The following properties must be configured to define a brickd connection:

    tinkerforge:hosts="<IP address>[:port] ..."

The properties indicated by '<...>' need to be replaced with an actual value. Properties surrounded
by square brackets are optional.

| <b>Property</b> | <b>Description</b> |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| IP address | IP address of the brickd |
| port | The listening port of of the brickd (optional, default 4223) |

For connecting several brickds, use multiple &lt;IP address&gt; statements delimited by a space.

Devices which do not support callbacks will be polled with a configurable interval, the default
 is 60000 milliseconds. This value can be changed in openhab.cfg:

    tinkerforge.refresh=<value in milliseconds>

#### Item Binding Configuration

In order to bind an item to a device, you need to provide configuration settings. The easiest way
to do so is to add binding information in your item file (in the folder '${openhab_home}/configurations/items').

The configuration of the TinkerForge binding item looks like this:

    tinkerforge="(uid=<id> [, subid=<id>] | name=<name>)"

The configuration is quite simple. You either have to set a value for the uid and optionally for the
subid of the device, or - if the device is configured in openhab.cfg - the "symbolic name" of the device.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| uid      | TinkerForge uid of the device (Use the Brick Viewer to get this value) |
| subid    | optional subid of the device|
| name     | _symbolic name_ of the device. The name is only available if there is some configuration for the device in openhab.cfg. |

#### Item Types  
Supported item types are "Switch Item", "Number Item", "Contact Item" and "String Item".

#### Example Configuration

Example for a connection to a single brickd:

    tinkerforge:hosts=127.0.0.1

Example for several brickd connections using different ports:

    tinkerforge:hosts=127.0.0.1:4224 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.104

### Advanced Configuration
There are several configuration parameters to control the behavior of the devices. The available
parameters depend on the device type.

#### Overview
For most of the devices **no configuration** is needed in openhab.cfg, they can be used with reasonable
defaults. The only exception is the IO16 Bricklet (see below).

If you want to get rid of _uid_ and _subid_ statements in the items or rule file, you can use openhab.cfg
to get a _symbolic name_.

A configuration line for a TinkerForge Device looks like this in openhab.cfg:

    tinkerforge:<symbolic name>.<property>=<value>

The *symbolic name* string can be used in the items configuration as an alternative for the uid and subid values.

The following table lists the general available properties.

|<b>Property</b>|<b>Description</b>|<b>Device</b>|
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
|uid|TinkerForge uid of the device (use the Brick Viewer to get this value)|mandatory for all devices|
|type|the device type|mandatory for all devices|
|subid|  subid of the device, subid's are used if a brick/bricklet houses more then one device (e.g. the Dual Relay Bricklet)|mandatory for sub devices|

The following table shows the TinkerForge device, its device type, subid and if it is an actuator.

#### Callback and Threshold

The TinkerForge CallbackListeners - if available - are used to observe the sensor values of the
devices. These listeners are configured to update sensor values at a given time period
(callbackPeriod). The default configuration sets the **callbackPeriod** to 1 second. This value can
be changed in openhab.cfg. For now this value must be changed for every single device. The values
must be given in milliseconds.

The callbackPeriod controls the amount of traffic from the TF hardware to the binding.

In addition to the Callback a **threshold value** can be configured. This threshold means that even
if the listener reports a changed value, the value is only send to the openHAB eventbus if: the
difference between the last value and the current value is bigger than the threshold value. You can
think of it as a kind of hysteresis, it dampens the oscillation of openHAB item values.

The threshold controls the amount of  traffic from the binding to the openHAB eventbus.


## News

## Red Brick
openHAB is preinstalled on the RED Brick image and can be configured with the TinkerForge BrickViewer.

## Tinkerforge Actions
The new openHAB action [[TinkerForgeAction|Actions]] comes up with the actions tfServoSetposition, tfClearLCD and tfDCMotorSetspeed.
tfServoSetposition(uid, num, position, velocity, acceleration) can be used to control the servo.
tfClearLCD(uid) uid is the uid of the LCD display. A call of tfClearLCD will clear the LCD display.
tfDCMotorSetspeed(String uid, String speed, String acceleration, String drivemode) can be used to control a DC motor.

  Example:

  ```
  tfServoSetposition("6Crt5W", "servo0", "-9000", "65535", "65535")
  ```

## Upgrading
### Upgrading from 1.3
- LCDBacklight now is a sub device of LCD20x4 Bricklet (items file has to be changed)
- LCD20x4Button now posts an update not a command anymore (rules has to be changed)
- IndustrialQuadRelay sub id numbering now starts from zero (items file has to be changed)

### Upgrading from 1.4
- Threshold values now have the same unit as the sensor value (incompatible change, you may have to update your openhab.cfg).
   - Background:
     Some getters for sensor values of the TinkerForge API return higher precision values by using short values with fractions of the common units, e.g. the Temperature Bricklet returns hundredths of a celsius degree. The binding converts these values to common units using a BigDecimal. Until now the threshold values were applied to the sensor value before this conversion. Because of that the threshold values had to be given as the appropriate fraction. With the drawback that the openHAB users need some knowledge about the behavior of the TinkerForge API. Now the threshold is applied after converting the original values. Therefore the units used for the sensor values and the threshold values are equal.
