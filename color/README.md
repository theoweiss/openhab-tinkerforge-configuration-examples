Color Bricklet
=================
There are three sub devices: joystick_xposition, joystick_yposition and joystick_button.
Callback period for xy position defaults to 10 milli seconds. CallbackPeriod must be configured
on bricklet_joystick device, because x and y position can not have
different callback periods.
